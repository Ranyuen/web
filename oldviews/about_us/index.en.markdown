Welcome to RANYUEN website.

Over the years, we have specialized in growing and breeding Calanthe (EBINE), AWACHIDORI / YUMECHIDORI (Ponerorchis) and other native Japanese orchids. To capture the hearts of fans around the world, we have spent over 40 years of orchid breeding to introduce the touch-of-class orchids. Currently, we grow over two million orchids in our thirty-four greenhouses.

Enjoy our website as we take you through more than 2000 pictures of various EBINE and AWACHIDORI / YUMECHIDORI on our website.
